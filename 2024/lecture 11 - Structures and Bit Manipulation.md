# Midterm Exam: Question #6 Solution

![bg w:650 left](HN_midterm/P6.png)

- Look closely at the first `if`: `opt = '+'` and NOT `opt == '+'`
- In C (and many programming languages), the *value* of the assignment operator `=` is equal to the assigned value.
- Why? So you can chain assignments, e.g., `x = y = 10;`
- So, the value of `opt = '+'` is nonzero, i.e., logical *true*.

# Recap: Pass by Value ⩇⩇:⩇⩇ vs. by Reference 👉(⩇⩇:⩇⩇)

``` C
#include <stdio.h>

double div2_pass_by_value(double x) {
    return x / 2;
}


double div2_pass_by_reference(double *x_ptr) {
    double x = *x_ptr;  // store the value pointed to by x_ptr to x
    *x_ptr = x / 2;     // store the value of x/2 to the addresses pointed to by x_ptr
    return *x_ptr;      // return the value of x_ptr
}

int main() {
    double a = 20;
    double b = div2_pass_by_value(a);
    printf("a=%5.1lf  b=%5.1lf\n", a, b);   // a= 20.0  b= 10.0
    a = div2_pass_by_reference(&b);
    printf("a=%5.1lf  b=%5.1lf\n", a, b);   // a=  5.0  b=  5.0
    return 0;
}
```

---

# C Functions with Multiple Outputs

- In C, a function may accept multiple inputs but may only return one value 💃
- What to do when you would like to return multiple values 💃🏻🕺🏽?

## Option 1: Pass output variables by reference

``` C
#include <limits.h>  // INT_MIN and INT_MAX are defined in the numerical limits header file
void min_max_call_by_ref(int *min, int *max, int *a, unsigned length) {
    // Find the minimum and maximum value found in an array
    // Input parameters: a, length
    // Output parameters: min, max
    assert(length > 0);
    *min = INT_MAX;
    *max = INT_MIN;
    for (unsigned i = 0; i < length; i++) {
        if (a[i] < *min) *min = a[i];
        if (a[i] > *max) *max = a[i];
    }
}
```

---

# C Functions with Multiple Outputs

## Option 2: Return a structure variable

``` C
struct MinMax {
    int min;
    int max;
};

struct MinMax min_max_by_struct(int *a, unsigned length) {
    // Find the minimum and maximum value found in an array
    struct MinMax tuple = {INT_MAX, INT_MIN};
    assert(length > 0);
    for (unsigned i = 0; i < length; i++) {
        if (a[i] < tuple.min) tuple.min = a[i];
        if (a[i] > tuple.max) tuple.max = a[i];
    }
    return tuple;
}
```

---

# Structure Variables Should (Probably) Always Be Passed by Reference 📢

- Passing a variable to a function will be *by value* ⩇⩇:⩇⩇
- Recall: a copy of a variable is created when passed by value ⩇⩇:⩇⩇+⩇⩇:⩇⩇
## Disadvantages of passing by value:
  - Memory requirement is doubled
  - CPU time 💻 to perform the copy
##  Advantage of passing by value:
  - May provide some protection 😷: modification of the copied value in the function does not affect the variable passed to the function

---

# The `const` Type Qualifier

- A `const` 🔒 variable informs that compiler that the variable is *read-only*
- Modification of a `const` variable results in a compile-time error

``` C
int main() {
    int x = 10;
    const int y = x;
    y = 0;                       // ERROR
    // error: cannot assign to variable 'y' with const-qualified type 'const int'
    int *y_ptr = &y;             // WARNING
    // warning: initializing 'int *' with an expression of type 'const int *'
    //          discards qualifiers
    *y_ptr = 0;                  // UNDEFINED BEHAVIOR!
    const int *y_ptr_const = &y; // VALID
    x = y_ptr_const[2];          // VALID
    y_ptr_const[2] = 20;         // ERROR
    // error: read-only variable is not assignable
    return 0;
}
```

---

# Balance ⚖️: Pass by Reference Via `const` Pointer

- Using `const`, you can pass a variable by reference to a function and guarantee that the function cannot modify the variable's value 😷
``` C
void min_max_call_by_ref(int *min, int *max, const int *a, unsigned length) {
    // Find the minimum and maximum value found in an array
    // Input parameters: a, length
    // Output parameters: min, max
    assert(length > 0);
    *min = INT_MAX;
    *max = INT_MIN;
    for (unsigned i = 0; i < length; i++) {
        if (a[i] < *min) *min = a[i];
        if (a[i] > *max) *max = a[i];
    }
}
```
- You can have your cake 🍰 and eat it too 😋!

# Bitwise Arithmetic Operators in C

- C provides arithmetic operators for *bitwise* 👾 manipulation of values
- By bitwise, we mean that a value is operated on one bit at a time:

<div align="center">

| $a_i$ | $b_i$ | $a_i$ `&` $b_i$ (AND) | $a_i$ `\|` $b_i$ (OR) | $a_i$ `^` $b_i$ (XOR) | `~`$a_i$ (NOT) |
|-------|-------|:---------------------:|:---------------------:|:---------------------:|:--------------:|
| 0     | 0     | 0                     | 0                     | 0                     | 1              |
| 0     | 1     | 0                     | 1                     | 1                     | 1              |
| 1     | 0     | 0                     | 1                     | 1                     | 0              |
| 1     | 1     | 1                     | 1                     | 0                     | 0              |

</div>

``` C
int x = 0b101010;   // = 32 +  8 + 2 = 42
int y = 0b111000;   // = 32 + 16 + 8 = 56
int z = x ^ y;      // 0b010010 = 16 + 2 = 18
```

---

# ⚠️☠️🚨 Arithmetic vs. Logical Operators

- We previously learned the *logical* 🖖 operators `&&`, `||`, and `!`
- **DO NOT** confuse these with the *bitwise arithmetic* 🧮 operators `&`, `|`, and `~`

``` C
int x = 42;  // = 32 +  8 + 2 = 0b101010
int y =  0;  //               = 0b000000

printf("x||y = %d\n", x || y);  // output: x || y = 1
printf(" x|y = %d\n",  x | y);  // output:  x | y = 42
// note the identity: x | 0 = x
// question to you: what is x & 1 = ?
```

- Remember:
  + Logical operators (`&&`, `||`, `!`) consider *values*
  + Arithmetic bitwise operators (`&`, `|`, `~`, `^`) consider the bits of values

# Use Case: Data Recovery 💾


- Suppose you have 3 disks, `X1`, `X2`, and `X3` that can each store 8 bits of information
- On a fourth disk `P`, the *parity* disk, store the XOR of each bit across the 3 disks

<div align='center'>

| Disk           | $b_8$ | $b_7$ | $b_6$ | $b_5$ | $b_4$ | $b_3$ | $b_2$ | $b_1$ |
|----------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| `X1`           | 0     | 0     | 0     | 0     | 1     | 1     | 1     | 1     |
| `X2`           | 1     | 0     | 1     | 0     | 1     | 0     | 1     | 0     |
| `X3`           | 1     | 1     | 0     | 1     | 0     | 0     | 1     | 1     |
| `P = X1^X2^X3` | 0     | 1     | 1     | 1     | 0     | 1     | 1     | 0     |

</div>

- In computer storage, this scheme is referred to as RAID 5 (distributed parity)
- Now, disk 2 fails &mdash; we will show that `X2` can be recovered from `X1`, `X3`, and `P`

---

# Use Case: Data Recovery 💾 (continued)

- First, some properties of the XOR operator:
  + Commutative: `X^Y = Y^X`
  + Associative: `X^(Y^Z) = (X^Y)^Z`
  + Two identities: `X^X=0` and `X^0 = X`
- `P ^ X1 ^ X3` = `(X1 ^ X2 ^ X3) ^ X1 ^ X3` = `(X1^X1) ^ (X3^X3) ^ X2 = X2`

<div align='center'>

| Disk          | $b_8$ | $b_7$ | $b_6$ | $b_5$ | $b_4$ | $b_3$ | $b_2$ | $b_1$ |
|---------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| `X1`          | 0     | 0     | 0     | 0     | 1     | 1     | 1     | 1     |
| `X3`          | 1     | 1     | 0     | 1     | 0     | 0     | 1     | 1     |
| `P`           | 0     | 1     | 1     | 1     | 0     | 1     | 1     | 0     |
| `P ^ X1 ^ X3` | 1     | 0     | 1     | 0     | 1     | 0     | 1     | 0     |

</div>

# Use Case: Swap 🔄 Variable Values

<div class="columns">

<div>

``` C
void SwapInt(int *x, int *y) {
    int temp = *x;
    *x = *y;
    *y = temp;
}
```

</div>

<div>

``` C
void XorSwapInt(int *x, int *y) {
  if (x == y) return;
  *x = *x ^ *y;
  *y = *x ^ *y;
  *x = *x ^ *y;
}
```

</div>
</div>

- Both functions above *swap* the values of two variables
- `XorSwapInt` does so without the need of extra memory storage
- Often found in classic 🏺👴🏻👵🏻 code where every byte was precious 💎
- Homework problem 📚☕:
  - Prove that `XorSwapInt` works for any input values
  - What happens if `if (x == y) return;` is removed?

# Bitwise Shift ➡️⬅️➡️➡️⬅️ Operators in C

- Left shift `x << N` shifts the bits of `x` to the left by `N` (inserting `0`s)
``` C
int x = 0b11;           // = 3
printf("%d\n", x << 3)  // ouput: 24
// Note that 0b11000 = 16 + 8 = 24
```
- Right shift `x >> N` shifts the bits of `x` to the right by `N` (inserting `0`s)

``` C
int x = 24;             // = 0b11000
printf("%d\n", x >> 2)  // output: 6
// Note that 6 = 4 + 2 = 0b110
```

- ⚠️ In C, the result of bit-shifting a negative value may be machine dependent and should be avoided!


---

# Example Bitwise Shift Use-Cases

- Computers are optimized 🏎️💨 for bit manipulation and some useful operations accomplished using a bitwise shift

### Is a value odd 🙃 or even 🙂?

- For an positive value, an integer is negative if its right-most bit is equal to `1`:

``` C
// Similar to: if ((x % 2) > 0) { ... }
if ((x & 1) > 0) {
    printf("The value of x is odd\n");
}
```

### Multiplication ✖ and division ÷ by 2

- `x << N` is similar to `x * (2 * N)` and `x >> M` is similar to `x / (2 * M)`

---

# Bit Fields

- A bit field is one way to efficiently represent a set of *flags*, i.e., on ✅ and off ❌ values, stored as `1`s and `0`s, respectively
- Example: Consider a Nintendo Entertainment System controller 🎮
  - 8 buttons: up, down, left, right, start, select, A, and B
  - Efficiently store the controller *state* with a `char` (which is $\geq$ 8 bits):

<div align="center">

| Bit     | 8  | 7    | 6    | 5     | 4     | 3      | 2 | 1 |
|---------|----|------|------|-------|-------|--------|---|---|
| Button  | up | down | left | right | start | select | A | B |

</div>

``` C
//                        udlrseAB
char controller_state = 0b10000010;  // store that "up" and "A" were pressed simultaneously
```

---

# Getting and Setting Bit Field Values

- Bitwise operators enable *bit masking* 🎭, i.e., bit field member selection

### Is the $N$th bit field entry (from the right) set?

``` C
char mask_bit_N = 0x1 << N;
int is_bit_N_on = (bit_field & mask_bit_N) != 0;
```

#### Example


``` C
//                        udlrseAB
char controller_state = 0b10000010;  // store that "up" and "A" were pressed simultaneously
//                                          seAB
char A_bitmask        = 1 << 1;      // = 0b0010
char start_bitmask    = 1 << 3;      // = 0b1000
if (controller_state & A_bitmask) printf("A pressed!\n");
if (controller_state & start_bitmask) printf("start pressed!\n");
```

---

# Getting and Setting Bit Field Values

### Set the $N$th bit field entry to `1` ("on")

``` C
bit_field |= mask_bit_N;  // equivalent to bit_field = bit_field | mask_bit_N;
```

#### Example

``` C
//                        udlrseAB
char controller_state = 0b10000010;  // store that "up" and "A" were pressed simultaneously
//                                          udlrseAB
char left_bitmask     = 1 << 5;      // = 0b00100000
controller_state |= left_bitmask;    // = 0b10100010
```

#### Homework problem

How would you set the $N$th bit of a bit field to `0` ("off")?

---

# Getting and Setting Bit Field Values

### Merge bit fields, i.e., combine the "on" bits from two bit fields

``` C
char combined_bit_field = bit_field1 | bit_field2;
```

#### Example

``` C
//                         udlrseAB
char controller_state1 = 0b10000010;  // store that "up" and "A" were pressed simultaneously
char controller_state2 = 0b00010010;  // store that "right" and "A" were pressed simultaneously
char merged_state = controller_state1 | controller_state2
//                     = 0b10010010
```
