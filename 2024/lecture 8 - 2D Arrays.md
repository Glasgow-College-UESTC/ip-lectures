# Lecture Outline

# Multidimensional Arrays

- 2D array akin to matrix (as in mathematics)

```C
int table[5][5]; // creates a 2D array of 5 rows and 5 columns
```

- How much size does a 2D array take?


```C
printf("size of array = %zu bytes\n", sizeof(table)); // %zu is for unsigned long
```

![bg right:30% 95%](assets/c_2darrays_tikz.svg "picture of a 2d array")

---

# Use in Mathematics üìê

- 2D matrices heavily used in matrix manipulation
- Backbone of linear algebra and numerical computation

![bg right:30% 95%](assets/c_2darrays_ID_matrix.svg "a nice 2D matrix")

```C
#include <stdio.h>
#define N 5 // size of the matrix size is always 1 more
int main(void)
{

    int ident_matrix[N][N];
    int row, col;
    for (row = 0; row < N; row++)
        for (col = 0; col < N; col++)
            if (row == col)
                ident_matrix[row][col] = 1;
            else
                ident_matrix[row][col] = 0;
    return 0;
}
```

---

# Multidimensional Array Initialisation 

```C
int ident_matrix[5][5] = {{1, 1, 1, 0, 1},
            {0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 2},
            {0, 5, 7, 9, 10, 12},
            {3, 7, -1, 3, 32, 76},
            {0, 3, 5, -4, 1, 8}};
```

- Empty elements are initialised to `0`
- C treats multidimensional arrays as 1D essentially.
- We can go out of bounds in terms of indices.

```C
printf("&array[%d][%d] = %p\n", row, col,  (void *)&ident_matrix[row][col]);
```

---

# Function Calls and Arrays üîë

- Recall the concept of <span style="color:green">passing by reference</span> and <span style="color:red">by value</span>

```C
someFunction(ArrayName); // passing by reference. Array name is a pointer
```

Passing by Reference
- We pass the <span style="color:green">array name</span> i.e., a pointer
- Since we pass the memory locations, contents are changed inside the function

![bg right:45% 95%](assets/passing.gif "an animation showing the concept of passing by reference and value")

---

# Passing by value

- We pass individual elements of the array
- There is no pointer passed
- No changes made to the original array contents

```C
someOtherFunction(AnotherArrayName[0]); // passing by value. Argument is an element
```

---

# Pointers üîë

- Just another data type
- A key feature of C
- Allows <span style="color:green">byte-sized</span> memory access
- A variable that stores the memory address of another variable.

```C
int *ptr; // -> The variable ptr stores a pointer to an int
```

---

# <!--fit--> <span style="color:white"> Pointer stores the **address** of a memory location </span>

![bg opacity:100%](assets/gradient.jpg "decorative background")

---

# Why Pointers? ü§î

- Efficient memory management.
- Allows functions to modify variables directly.

---

# So what is all about Pointers?

- How to create/declare pointers?
- `&` (address-of): Gets the memory address.
- `*` (dereference): Accesses the value at the memory address.

```C
int a = 10;  // declare an integer variable
int *ptr; // declare a pointer 
ptr = &a;  // and initialize it to the address of 'a'
printf("%d", *ptr);  // dereference the pointer and print the value it points to
```

---

# Initialising and Indirect Assignment

- Pointers are like a map
- Variables are stored in memory, each at a unique address.
- <span style="color:red">Address Representation</span>
- Pointers allow access to these addresses directly.
- E.g., `int x = 5;` & `int *p = &x;`
- `p` now holds the memory address of `x`.

# Example üîë

```C
#include <stdio.h> // which has definitions of printf function

int main() // void means nothing
{
    int a = 10;         // declare an integer variable
    int *ptr;           // declare a pointer
    ptr = &a;          // and initialize it to the address of 'a'
    printf("%d\n", *ptr); // dereference the pointer and print the value it points to
    printf("%p\n", ptr); // print the value the pointer points to
    printf("%p\n", &a); //  print the address of a
    printf("%p\n", a); //  print the value of a
    return 0;
}
```

---

# Two Pointers

```C
#include <stdio.h> // which has definitions of printf function

int main() // void means nothing
{
    int a = 10; int b =20;         
    int *ptr1, *ptr2;           
    ptr1 = &a;          
    ptr2 = &b;
    printf("%d\n", *ptr1); 
    printf("%p\n", ptr2); 
    printf("%p\n", &a); 
    printf("%p\n", &b); 
    return 0;
}
```

# Pointer Arithmetic

- What happens when we perform arithmetic?
- We can simply *add*, *subtract* on pointers

```C
char *p;
char a;
char b;
p = &a;
p += 1;
```

- Adds `1*sizeof(char)` to the memory address
- The pointer `p` now points to ?? ü§î

---

# The Dangling Pointer ‚ùó

- **Null Pointer (`NULL`)**
- A pointer that doesn‚Äôt point to any address: `int *p = NULL;`
- A pointer pointing to deallocated memory.
- **Best Practice**
- Always initialise pointers, and set to `NULL` after freeing memory.
- Avoid unexpected behaviour and crashes üõë
- Memory area can be reused and data can be corrupted
