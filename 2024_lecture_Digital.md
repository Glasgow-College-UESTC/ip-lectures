- Sampling Theorem
- Interpolation
- Pulse Train

# Sampling Theorem

- A signal $g(t)$ with bandwidth $<B$ can be reconstructed exactly from samples taken at any rate $R>2B$.
- Sampling can be achieved mathematically by multiplying by an impulse train. 

$$
III(t) = \sum_{k = -\infty}^{\infty} \delta (t - k)
$$

- Also called a comb function

$$
\overline{g}(t) = III(t)g(t) = \sum_{k = -\infty}^{\infty} g(t)\delta (t - kT) = \sum_{k = -\infty}^{\infty} g(kT_s)\delta (t - kT_s)
$$

---

# The Impulse Train

- Interesting the Fourier Transform of an impulse train is also an impulse train
- The complex exponentials cancel at non-integer frequencies and add up to an impulse at integer frequencies

$$
\mathcal{F} {III(t)} = \mathcal{F} \sum_{k = -\infty}^{\infty} g(t)\delta (t - k) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-j2\pi n f} =  III(f)
$$

# Fourier Transform of a Sampled Signal

The impulse train $III(t/Ts)$ is periodic with period $T_s$ and can be represented as the sum of complex exponentials of all multiples of the
fundamental frequency,

$$
III(t/Ts) = 1/Ts \sum_{k = -\infty}^{\infty} e^{-j2\pi f_s t} 
$$

- $f_s = 1/T_s$

# The Minimum Sampling Rate
  
- When the sampling rate is too low, the spectral replicas overlap

![w:450 center](assets/aliasing_2.svg)

- The shaded frequencies overlap and are ambiguous.
- High positive frequencies wrap around to high negative frequencies
- What signal would you reconstruct if you assumed the signal was actually band limited?

---

# Aliasing Contd.

- Cosines at frequencies of 0.75 Hz and 1.25 Hz produce exactly the same samples at a sampling rate of 1 Hz

# Anti-aliasing Filter

- In practice, a sampler is always preceded by a filter to limit the signal bandwidth to match the sampling rate
- This may delete part of the signal if it isn‚Äôt bandlimited.
- It ensures that the signal that is sampled is bandlimited.

# Reconstruction

- In an ideal world ...
- To avoid spectral overlap, we need to ensure the sampling frequency is $>= 2B$

![w:550 center](assets/ideal_aliasing.svg)

---

# Realistic Reconstruction

- Due to causality we cant really have an ideal low-pass filter

![w:550 center](assets/interpolation.svg)

---

# Pulsed Sampling

- In reality, we will always a finite time pulse
- This will lead to further changes in the shape of the sampled signal

![w:750 center](assets/practical_interpolation_pulse.svg)

# Pulsed Sampling 

- At the recovery/reconstruction
- Equalisation is akin to frequency inversion (more later)

# Digital Modulation

- Analog vs Digital Communication
- Pulse Code Modulation (PCM)
- Quantisation

---

# Analog vs Digital Communication

- Analogue communication (baseband and modulated) is subject to noise.
- Pulse modulations (PAM, PWM, PPM) represent analogue signals by analogue variations in pulses and are also subject to noise.
- Long distance communication requires repeaters, which amplify signal and noise. Each link adds noise.
- Digital communication suppresses noise by regenerating signal.
