# The Art of Problem-Solving 

- Coming with a step-by-step plan
- We call the plan an *algorithm*
- Computers are good at processing algorithms
- We can <span style="color:green">automate</span> tasks

# Computer Programming

- Historically, we have found ways to solve our problems with the use of numbers.
- Computers are very good at dealing with numbers.
- We need to tell the computer <span style="color:red">exactly</span> what to do.
- Sequence of instructions is called a computer program

---

# Computers 💻

- Computers are **phenomenally** faster than us in performing calculations.
- Computers _only_ directly understand <span style="color:red">machine language</span>.
- Communication with computers require *assemblers*.
- High-level Languages require *compilers*

---

# Why C? 🤔

- C is a by-product of UNIX operating system
- Developed in the 1970s at Bell Laboratories by Ken Thompson
- *High-level* Programming language
- Linux, Windows, and Android are written in **C**
- **C** can run on <span style="color:red">ANY</span>  computer
